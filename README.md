## Team 4, Spring 2021 Game Design at W&M

### Overview
Experience the thrills of the kitchen as you play through a variety of minigames that test your rhythm and reflexes to become one of the top chefs in the world. Become immersed in the world of cooking through the game’s storyline and compelling atmosphere, not commonly seen in the rhythm genre. The chef’s story adds a sense of unity and immersion to the game, giving the minigames meaning unlike other rhythm games like Rhythm Heaven and Wario Ware which lack a cohesive storyline.
